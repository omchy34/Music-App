Sure! Let's break down the line of code `{currentSong && <p>Now Playing: {currentSong.split('/').pop()}</p>}` step by step:

### Context

This line is part of the `Spotify` component's JSX, which renders a message indicating the currently playing song.

### Breakdown

1. **Conditional Rendering**: `{currentSong && ...}`

   - `currentSong` is a state variable that holds the path of the currently playing song.
   - `currentSong &&` is a logical AND operation.
   - This expression ensures that the code inside the `{}` braces is only executed if `currentSong` is truthy (i.e., not `null`, `undefined`, `false`, `0`, `NaN`, or an empty string).
   - If `currentSong` is truthy, the `<p>` element will be rendered; otherwise, nothing will be rendered.

2. **`<p>` Element**: `<p>Now Playing: {currentSong.split('/').pop()}</p>`

   - This `<p>` element is an HTML paragraph element that will be rendered if `currentSong` is truthy.
   - Inside the `<p>` element, the text "Now Playing:" is displayed, followed by the name of the current song.

3. **Extracting the Song Name**: `{currentSong.split('/').pop()}`
   - `currentSong` contains the full path to the currently playing song (e.g., `'../../../components/Music/Baaghi-Sab_Tera.mp3'`).
   - `currentSong.split('/')` splits the `currentSong` string into an array of substrings, using '/' as the delimiter.
     - For example, `'../../../components/Music/Baaghi-Sab_Tera.mp3'` would be split into `['..', '..', '..', 'components', 'Music', 'Baaghi-Sab_Tera.mp3']`.
   - `.pop()` is then called on the resulting array.
     - `.pop()` removes and returns the last element of the array, which is the file name of the song (`'Baaghi-Sab_Tera.mp3'` in this case).
   - The file name is then inserted into the paragraph text, displaying the name of the current song without its path.

### Example

Let's say `currentSong` is set to `'../../../components/Music/Baaghi-Sab_Tera.mp3'`.

- `currentSong.split('/')` results in `['..', '..', '..', 'components', 'Music', 'Baaghi-Sab_Tera.mp3']`.
- `.pop()` on this array returns `'Baaghi-Sab_Tera.mp3'`.
- The paragraph element `<p>Now Playing: Baaghi-Sab_Tera.mp3</p>` is rendered.

### Summary

The line `{currentSong && <p>Now Playing: {currentSong.split('/').pop()}</p>}` conditionally renders a paragraph displaying the name of the currently playing song. It uses the `split` method to break the file path into parts and `pop` to get the last part (the file name) to display it to the user.
